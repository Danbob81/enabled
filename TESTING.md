## User Story Testing

### Regular Staff User Goals

  - user can log in securely; warning does show if incorrect username or password have been entered

  - the site is easy to navigate with buttons/links clearly defined
  - the user can easily search and view customer details
  - customer records can be created and amended easily
  - Minor Works orders can be created easily with information clearly visible
  - orders can be set as completed making the order only able to be viewed afterwards
  - users are able to view orders and can amend them easily unless set to completed
  - notes can be added and updated on all orders unless order is set to completed
  - if the user has created the order, they are able to delete it. No other user can delete that order

### Admin User Goals

  - only the Admin user is able to access the Manage Users section of the site
  - Admin can 
    - create new users easily
    - search for and view user information
    - amend user details
    - delete user accounts except for the Admin account which can not be deleted using the site
