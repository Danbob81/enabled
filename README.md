## User Experience (UX) 

### Brief

The local authorities Aids & Adaptations service, which provides equipment and in-home adaptations to vulnerable disabled and elderly residents within the borough, are looking at streamlining their departments to improve accessibility to services. The current service is spread across multiple authority departments all using different software packages for their needs but which donâ€™t communicate with each other. 

The service provider is asking for one software solution that will enable better access to information and more effective communication between departments. They also wish to provide a customer portal which will give access to customers, enabling them to register with the service online and keep track of adaptations orders on their account.
