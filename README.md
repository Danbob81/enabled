# **User Experience (UX)** 

## **Brief**

The local authorities Aids & Adaptations service, which provides equipment and in-home adaptations to vulnerable disabled and elderly residents within the borough, are looking for a solution to improve information sharing between service departments. The current service is spread across multiple authority departments and agencies, all using different software packages for their needs but which donâ€™t communicate with each other. Thus, being reliant on the use of email, chat services (such as MS Teams), and telephone to request and share information relating to orders being requested.

The service provider is asking for a software solution that will enable better access to information and more effective communication between departments. They wish to start with the Minor Works ordering service and, later, on appraisal, expand the system to be used by other services.

## **Testing**

Chrome Developer Tool was used to simulate the different viewport sizes for desktop and laptop views, tablet views and mobile views. I used this throughout the development process as well as for testing the website once it was deployed to Heroku.

The deployed website was also tested using Chrome, Edge and Firefox as well as on mobile (using Chrome for Android)

More detailed information of the testing carried out can be viewed in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

## **Deployment**

### **Site deployed to Heroku**

**Requirements for Deployment:**
  - Python
  - MongoDB account and database
  - GitHub account
  - Heroku account

**Process:**
  - MONGO_DBNAME - database name needed to be connected to in MongoDB.
  - MONGO_URI - find this on the MongoDB website by following these steps:
    - in the clusters tab of your database, click connect on the associated cluster.
    - click 'Connect', then 'Connect your application'.
    - copy the string, then change the password (from Database access NOT your MongoDB password) 
    - change "myFirstDB" to your MONGO_DBNAME

  - SECRET_KEY - a custom string set up to keep sessions secure. Password generated by [RandomKeygen](https://bit.ly/3IwUxuI)

**Deployment to Heroku:**
  - create requirements.txt file and Procfile by running these commands in terminal:
    - `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    - `echo web: python run.py > Procfile`
  - push to repository
  - create .gitignore file if you don't already have one
  - add `env.py` and `__pycache__/` to the .gitignore file and save it. Sensitive information will now not be added to your repository
  - create env.py file with the following information:
    - `import os`

    - `os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")`
    - `os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")`
    - `os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", " ## YOUR SECRET_KEY ## ")`
    - `os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", " ## YOUR MONGO_URI ## ")`
    - `os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB", " ## YOUR MONGO_DBNAME ## ")`
  
  - log in to [Heroku](https://bit.ly/3HqWiYV)
  - select 'Create New App' in the dashboard
  - choose your app name, select the region nearest you and click 'Create App'
  - go to 'Deploy' tab, 'Deployment Method' and select 'GitHub'
  - search for your GitHub repo and click 'Connect'
  - go to 'Settings' tab, 'Config Vars' and select 'Reveal Config Vars'
  - enter key value pairs from your env.py file
  - go to 'Deploy' tab and select 'Enable Automatic Deployment'
  - choose the branch to deploy from
  - click 'Deploy Branch' to deploy your app onto Heroku servers
  - let app finish building then click 'Open App' to view your site
