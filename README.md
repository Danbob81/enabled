# User Experience (UX) 

## Brief

The local authorities Aids & Adaptations service, which provides equipment and in-home adaptations to vulnerable disabled and elderly residents within the borough, are looking for a solution to improve information sharing between service departments. The current service is spread across multiple authority departments and agencies, all using different software packages for their needs but which donâ€™t communicate with each other. Thus, being reliant on the use of email, chat services (such as MS Teams), and telephone to request and share information relating to orders being requested.

The service provider is asking for a software solution that will enable better access to information and more effective communication between departments. They wish to start with the Minor Works ordering service and, later, on appraisal, expand the system to be used by other services.
